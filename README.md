## About

This is a simple browser-based balloon pop game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Balloons appear randomly on the screen, and users click them to pop and increase their score.  
I built this project to practice event handling, random positioning, animations, and updating the score dynamically using JavaScript.

## Built With

`HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript`

## What I Learned

- How to handle click events, manage game state (score, timer), and update the UI dynamically in JavaScript.
